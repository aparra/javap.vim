This command allows you to run the JDK utility javap to show the methods in a class found in your classpath.  This function assumes that you have your classpath set up and that you have javap in your path.

It's useful when I want to know a method or constructor signature and don't want to look up the javadocs for it.

To use it just go to the ex prompt and ...

:Javap fully_qualified_classname

For example,

:Javap java.lang.String;
